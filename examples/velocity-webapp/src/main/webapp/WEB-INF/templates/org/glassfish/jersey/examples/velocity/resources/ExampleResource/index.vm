        <h1>Velocity Examples</h1>
        <p>The links below provide examples of Velocity usage. Each example page includes a <a href="#features">Features</a> section
            to highlight what to look for in that example.</p>
        <h2 id=features>Features</h2>
        <p>We've already used some Velocity features here:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Used the Viewable's model</li>
            <li>Iterated over the contents of the model with a \#foreach loop</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The ExampleResource (Controller) provides this Velocity template (View) with a List of javax.ws.rs.core.Link objects (Model).</p>
        <p>As the provided model (List) is iterable, we can simply loop over it.  The loop is handled
            using the template \#foreach function, which we use to convert the Link object into HTML anchors.</p>
        <h2>Examples</h2>
        <table>
        #foreach($item in $it)
            <tr>
                <td>
                   <a href="$item.uri">$item.title</a>
                </td>
            </tr>
        #end
        </table>
